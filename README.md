### Notes

Building the base app went smoothly with the walkthrough and a few changes due to version differences.
Implementing transitions took a while as I tried to use the Pair class but the import statement CodePath said to use was not recognized. Much googling did not fix this. I realize now I should've asked in the Slack help chat but the transition is still implemented on the title.
The CodePath provided code for rounding corners used GlideApp which Android didn't recognize at all. Changing GlideApp to Glide fixed this issue.

   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
I accidentally forgot to change my layout xml files to RelativeLayout so had to teach myself ConstraintLayout. Thankfully, this layout appeared to be better suited for the task.
